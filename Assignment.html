			Here is a quote from Wikipedia on Dogs
			</h3>
			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog">
			 Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. 
			 This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend."
